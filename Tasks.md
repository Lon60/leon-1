- [ ] Support @traceInduct for proving timebounds. For this we need to handle templates in body.
- [ ] allow compisitional verification
- [ ] support @finite annotation
- [ ] Support type instances in closure conversion
- [ ] benchmarks ? iterative DP, lazy pairing heaps, implicit queues, amortized bounds, cyk ?
- [ ] collect results for timing and allocations
- [ ] compare with related works e.g. Vasconsolos work.
- [ ] Consider the application of synthesizing thresholds
